# Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration, based on [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). I've made modifications and added customizations to suit my workflow and needs.

## Acknowledgments

The base configuration is heavily inspired by [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). If you're looking for a clean starting point for your own Neovim setup, I highly recommend checking it out.
